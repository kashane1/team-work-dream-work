Following the link above will bring you to the Weather Magic!

Requirements:
-----------
1. The application will generate a webpage that displays my team's basic info. There will be quick access to user's emails and GitHub profiles.
2. Using inquirer, the user answers questions about their employees.
3. After all the inputs, then an HTML page is generated.
4. I included the sample HTML file that was generated in the walkthrough video.

Definitely the most challenging project so far. I struggled with the structure of the application and tried a few setups. Ultimately, arriving at this setup that holds most of the functionality in employee.js. Then working with inquirer and making it repeat new questions was a challenge as well. And after all that, then working with the tests was a whole other beast. I will need a lot more practice here. I don't think I completed the test section of the assignment, but I gave it a solid attempt.
